An order management system for a restaurant is being developed, Implement the IOrder and IOrder System interface as described.

Create a class called Order implementing Order interface.

Create a new class called OrderSystem and implement the Order System interface supporting following use-cases.

Add the order item to the cart

Remove the order item from the cart

Calculate the discounted prices for each order in the cart and sum the values. Discounted Price-Order Price-((Order Price Discount Rate)/100).

Calculate discounts for each product category in the cart. The method returns a map of categories name and the discount amount. (key category, value category discount)

Retrieve the list of items in the cart along with their quantities.

Category determination is done as follows:

Order Price - 10: Cheap

Order Price <- 20 and Order Price > 10: Moderate

Order Price > 20: Expensive

The discount per category is as follows:

Cheap-10%

Moderate-20%

â€¢ Expensive-30%

Example

There are 2 Order objects, with name, price,

Pizza 40

Sandwich 30

After they are added, calculate the total amount from orders,

eg. The Price for Pizza-40 and 40>20, so the discount equals 30%. The discounted price=40-((40*30)/100)=28. Similarly, the 30% discounted price of Sandwich is 21.

Output:

Total Amount: 49

Expensive Category Discount: 21

Pizza (1 items)
